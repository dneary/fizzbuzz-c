FizzBuzz in C
=============

This program prints the whole numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive, with multiples of 3 replaced by
"Fizz", multiples of 5 replaced by "Buzz", and multiples of 15 replaced by "FizzBuzz". It is
intended to be very simple to show features of inline IDEs and GitHub's integrated CI tooling,
GitHub Actions.
